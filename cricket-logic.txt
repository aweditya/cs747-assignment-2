Structure:
What happens when A gets out?
What happens when A gets 0 runs?
What happens when A gets 1 run?
What happens when A gets 2 runs?
What happens when A gets 3 runs?
What happens when A gets 4 runs?
What happens when A gets 5 runs?
What happens when A gets 6 runs?

Remember: We can reduce the number of transitions (If you cannot make T runs in O balls, there is no need to do a case by case analysis for those)

Let the current state be (T,O) {T runs left, O balls left}
1) A gets out (Game ends):
O = O - 1
Send A to (T, 0) with reward 0

2) A gets 0 runs:
O = O - 1
If (O divisible by 6):
	Rotate strike
	Call B's behaviour
	
Else (O not divisible by 6):
	Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
	
3) A gets 1 run:
O = O - 1
T = T - 1
If (T == 0):
	Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
Else:
	If (O divisible by 6):
		Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
	Else:
		Rotate strike
		Call B's behaviour
		
4) A get 2 runs:
O = O - 1
T = T - 2
If (T == 0):
	Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
Else:
	If (O divisible by 6):
		Rotate strike
		Call B's behaviour
	Else:
		Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
		
5) A gets 3 runs:
O = O - 1
T = T - 3
If (T == 0):
	Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
Else:
	If (O divisible by 6):
		Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
	Else:
		Rotate strike
		Call B's behaviour

6) A gets 4 runs:
O = O - 1
T = T - 4
If (T == 0):
	Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
Else:
	If (O divisible by 6):
		Rotate strike
		Call B's behaviour
	Else:
		Send A to (T, O) with reward 0

7) A gets 5 runs:
O = O - 1
T = T - 5
If (T == 0):
	Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
Else:
	If (O divisible by 6):
		Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
	Else:
		Rotate strike
		Call B's behaviour

8) A gets 6 runs:
O = O - 1
T = T - 6
If (T == 0):
	Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
Else:
	If (O divisible by 6):
		Rotate strike
		Call B's behaviour
	Else:
		Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
				
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Combining all the above cases into one:
Suppose A gets k runs
O = O - 1
If (k == -1): // Game over
	Send A to state (T, 0) with reward 0
Else:
	T = T - k
	If (k is odd):
		If (T == 0):
			Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
		Else:
			If (O divisible by 6):
				Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
			Else:
				Rotate strike
				Call B's behaviour
	Else (k is even):
		If (T == 0):
			Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
		Else:
			If (O divisible by 6):
				Rotate strike
				Call B's behaviour
			Else:
				Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
				
-----------------------------------------------------------------------		
B's behaviour:

p = 1 // To keep track of the probability of each event
While (True):
	O = O - 1
	if O == 0 and T != 0:
		Send A to (T, 0) with reward 0
		break
	
	If (B gets out): // with probability q
		Send A to (T, 0) with reward 0
	
	Else If (B defends):
		p = p*(1-q)/2 
		If (O divisible by 6):
			Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
			break
		Else:
			continue
			
	Else (B gets 1 run):
		T = T - 1
		If (T == 0):
			Send A to (0, O) with reward 1
			break
		
		If (O divisible by 6):
			continue
		Else:
			Send A to (T, O) with reward 0
			break
